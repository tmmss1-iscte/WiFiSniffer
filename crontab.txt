# The crontab utility allows to configure tasks to be run
# automatically on pre-determined time-schedules.
#
# This file can be used to run the 'main.py' script when the sniffer boots up.
#
# For more information about the project check 'https://github.com/tmmss1-iscte/WiFiSniffer'.
# Also see 'https://crontab.guru' for knowing how to schedule tasks.
#
#
# Keep in mind that the location of the 'WiFiSniffer' project software may differ to ,
# your sniffer device, and so you may need to change the filepath of the command to be run.
#
# To automatically run the 'main.py' script on boot, the sniffer will execute the following task on boot:
@reboot sleep 40 && sudo -E /usr/bin/python3 /home/kali/Desktop/WiFiSniffer/main.py
